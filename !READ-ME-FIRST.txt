----------------------------------------------------

1. Open '/lib/db.class.php' & '/admin/lib/db.class.php' and modify your site URL and database values
2. Navigate to the web address / directory where you uploaded the script
3. Enter your Site Name, and check over the database information to make sure it is correct
4. Run the installation, and if successful, you should be redirected to login to the admin page
5. Default admin login -- username: admin    password: ezadmin
6. After logging in successfully, navigate back to the main index page (the user-frontend side)
7. If you encounter no issues, please delete the 'install.php' file from your server as a security risk

LICENSING
In the near future licenses can be purchased which will grant users application support & premium application upgrades.

NOTES
ezLeague v3.0 had 95% of previous code re-written, and because of that, v2.x will no longer be supported. I will try to release a v2.x to 3.0 upgrade utility, but no promises. 

HOW TO UPDATE
Be sure to register a GitHub account, and download ezLeague by "cloning" it using the GitHub GUI Application (this can be downloaded at http://windows.github.com). When ezLeague updates are released, simply "sync" the repository, and upload the modified files. In some cases, when a database update has been made, users will need to run the upgrade script

HOW TO UPGRADE
When database updates have been made...
1. Login to your admin panel
2. Navigate to http://your-web-site.com/admin/upgrade.php [ex: http://www.mdloring.com/ezl/admin/upgrade.php]
3. A success message will be shown if the upgrade went through

HOW TO HELP
If you're interested in helping with the future of this project, by all means, please contact me. It'd be great to work 
with other developers, and maybe, just maybe, even have a small community built out of this project, which seems to be 
happening already.
