1. Open '/lib/db.class.php' & '/admin/lib/db.class.php' and modify your site URL and database values
2. Navigate to the web address / directory where you uploaded the script
3. Enter your Site Name, and check over the database information to make sure it is correct
4. Run the installation, and if successful, you should be redirected to login to the admin page
5. Default admin login -- username: admin    password: ezadmin
6. After logging in successfully, navigate back to the main index page (the user-frontend side)
7. If you encounter no issues, please delete the 'install.php' file from your server as a security risk

NOTES: A lot of work has gone into the base of this project, regardless of how limited the functionality is at this moment. More functionality will be added over time, but I thought it was important to get a stable release out as quickly as possible after the numerous emails I've received over the months. Also, this project and code is not meant to be perfect -- there will be bugs, and of course, there are and always will be better ways to write certain aspects and functions of this project. Instead of trying to over-complicate functionality, I wanted even the most beginner programmer to be able to go through this code and understand how it works, which I feel has been achieved. 

If you're interested in helping with the future of this project, by all means, please contact me. It'd be great to work with other developers, and maybe, just maybe, even have a small community built out of this project, which seems to be happening already.

All the best,
