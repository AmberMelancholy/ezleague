ezLeague Installation Guide
----------------------------------------------------

1. Open '/lib/db.class.php' & '/admin/lib/db.class.php' and add your database values
2. Run '/install.php' -- This will create the necessary database tables
3. Navigate to http://your-ezleague-installation.com/admin -- you will be prompted to create your Admin Account
4. After you have completed the past steps, delete the 'install.php' file
5. Enjoy, and please report any and all bugs.
-----------------------------------------------------

NOTES: A lot of work has gone into the base of this project, regardless of how limited the functionality is at this moment. More functionality will be added over time, but I thought it was important to get a stable release out as quickly as possible after the numerous emails I've received over the months. Also, this project and code is not meant to be perfect -- there will be bugs, and of course, there are and always will be better ways to write certain aspects and functions of this project. Instead of trying to over-complicate functionality, I wanted even the most beginner programmer to be able to go through this code and understand how it works, which I feel has been achieved. 

If you're interested in helping with the future of this project, by all means, please contact me. It'd be great to work with other developers, and maybe, just maybe, even have a small community built out of this project, which seems to be happening already.

All the best,
