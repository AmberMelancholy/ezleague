Welcome to ezLeague v1.2

If you are upgrading your installation from a previous version, follow the steps below, otherwise these upgrades have already been included in the new version.

HOW TO UPGRADE YOUR INSTALLATION AND WHAT IS BEING DONE
1) Login to your Admin Panel, and navigate to: your-site.com/admin/upgrade.php
2) If successful, a message will appear. If not, please check your DB settings in db.class.php
3) Delete the upgrade.php file from your server

The only operation this upgrade does is adding a new COLUMN (forget) to the USERS table.

Any issues, please post them on GitHub or my blog.
