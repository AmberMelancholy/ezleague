About ezLeague
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After writing 2-3 different PHP Gaming League scripts, I've received numerous emails over the past 6months asking to offer it up for download...but it wasn't exactly user friendly. So that's what ezLeague is.

Instead of having to build in a custom templating system, the front and backend are being built on Bootstrap to make theming easier for the user.

A full-list of features is soon to come. I'm still in debate on how to combine the 3 previous scripts I've written.

News, Leagues, Matches, Teams, Users, Site Settings, Support Multiple Games

Team/Guild Challenge System for Matches
Rankings will be built on an ELO algorithm, the same ranking system used for Chess Players ...more to be listed later

Admin Panel to control and modify all Leagues, Matches, Users and Data

How to Upgrade
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a new version is released, unless you have made your own changes to specific files, simply re-download ezLeague, and overwrite all files/folders EXCEPT for /lib/db.class.php & /admin/lib/db.class.php.

If you overwrite the db.class.php files, you'll have to re-add your database configuration information.

If you run into any issues, please post them on the Issues page (https://github.com/stoopkid1/ezleague/issues) and I'll look into it.
